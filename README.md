# Bancho API
API for custom osu!Bancho client and server software. 

This project contains some basic data and packet structures for reading and writing. This is not complete and there are still a lot of packets missing, however it should be fairly usable in this state.

As many of these kind of projects, I will take this down if peppy requests me to.

# Implementation
This is API is useless on it's own, so here are some projects where it is used:
* [bancho-client](https://github.com/ekgame/bancho-client) - a framework for osu! bots that uses osu!Bancho protocol.
* [bancho-server](https://github.com/ekgame/bancho-server) - a very basic custom Bancho server.
